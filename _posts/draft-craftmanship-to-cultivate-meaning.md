1. Everything have "potential". Example: a tree have a potential to be table, chair, toy, and others. And craftmanship is a way to cultivate the "potential". I see this "potential" as "meaning". 

2. Thus, we can see individual (his mind, senses, body, etc.) as a "vehicle" to "extract" meaning from the world.

3. But, there's another alternative. Maybe individual is not a vehicle and world is the "things that got extracted". Maybe the relationship is not dualism. Maybe craftmanship is a way to "become one" with the craft. Like, when you cultivate a tree to become table, you need to "become the table", i.e. think and behave as a table. 

4. There's a modern burden come from existensialism and departure from religion to create meaning from scratch. A view that there's no real meaning and human can create artifial meaning from anything. This seems not right for me.
